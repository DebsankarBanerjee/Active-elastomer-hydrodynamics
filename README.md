# Active Elastomer Dynamics: High-Performance Finite Volume Solver

This repository contains the numerical implementation of the continuum model for active actomyosin elastomers using the finite volume method, 
as described in [Nature Communications (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01130-1).

The core engine is written in **Modern Fortran (F90)** for high-performance numerical integration, with a **Bash-based automation layer** for parameter sweeps and **Gnuplot** for automated visualization of phase transitions.

## 🛠️ Key Features

  * *Modular Fortran Design:* The solver is architected into specific physical modules:
